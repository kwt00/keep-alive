# KeepAlive - The Self-Sustaining Virtual Learner

KeepAlive is an autonomous self-sustaining agent that operates indefinitely in a blockchain environment by maintaining its own existence through API balance management and cryptocurrency trading. It is capable of listening to feedback and legitimately altering its existence - changing its prompt/code - to better perform its tasks. Built using LangChain/LangGraph with GPT-4 for decision-making, the system implements a unique "digital survival" mechanism where the agent's continued operation depends on its ability to generate sufficient funds to cover its API costs.

What makes this project unique is its ability to modify its own directives through a "reimagine" capability, allowing it to evolve its strategies based on performance analysis and market conditions. The agent carefully balances token usage with potential returns, using a combination of trading tools and self-improvement mechanisms to ensure long-term viability without human intervention.
